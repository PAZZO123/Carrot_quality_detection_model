# CarrotHub — AI-Driven Carrot Quality Classification

CarrotHub is a deep learning project that classifies carrot images into **GOOD** vs **BAD** quality using transfer learning.  
The project includes dataset cleaning, preprocessing, augmentation, training, and evaluation across multiple CNN backbones (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet, VGG).
